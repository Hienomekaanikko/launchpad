So I have some music production background and a physical launchpad is rather familiar thing to me. So I wanted to practice some JS, html, css combination just 
to see how well can I adapt after being in the world of strictly C and C++ for such an intense period. 

So the plan is to have something like this:

<iframe width="768" height="432" src="https://miro.com/app/live-embed/uXjVJOWH7WA=/?embedMode=view_only_without_ui&moveToViewport=-535,-256,1152,656&embedId=173887963718" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allow="fullscreen; clipboard-read; clipboard-write" allowfullscreen></iframe>

5 rows of 5 sounds.
